# Noteable

A Zettelkasten-based note-taking system with decentralized note sharing using react, node.js and hardhat. 

Zettlekasten, or slip box, is a note-taking method that interlinks notes that can potentially lead to similar ideas. It helps users to form a net of knowledge points and generate new ideas from that. 

Our application is a middle ground of online apps and offline data storage: it can be hosted publicly for users who want convenience, and for users who are concerned with security issues they can host the app themselves and customize where to store the data. On top of the traditional slip box method, we add a note-sharing feature using blockchain for users using online and self-host versions of the app to share data together.
